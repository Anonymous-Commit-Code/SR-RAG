It is necessary to use a filter to remove the irrelevant parts to ensure the effectiveness of the safety analysis.\n\n<<< Goal >>>\nFilter out irrelevant or unsuitable safety analysis criteria, retaining only those that meet the current requirements.\n\n<<< Style >>>\nPrecise, concise.\n\n<<< Specific Requirements >>>\n\nAccept some safety analysis criteria, determine if filtering is needed. If so, remove irrelevant sentences or paragraphs and output the criteria that meet functional requirements. Otherwise, do not filter the original content.\nNo explanation needed.\n\n<<< Input Example 1 >>>\n\n{  \n  \"safety_criterions\": [  \n    \"Ensure all interfaces have appropriate authentication mechanisms.\",  \n    \"Airborne software\"  \n  ]  \n}\n\n<<< Output Example 1 >>>\n\n```json\n{  \n  \"need_filter\": true,\n  \"safety_criterions\": [  \n    \"Ensure all interfaces have appropriate authentication mechanisms.\"  \n  ]  \n}\n```\n\n<<< Input Example 2 >>>\n\n{  \n  \"safety_criterions\": [  \n    \"Ensure all interfaces have appropriate authentication mechanisms.\",  \n    \"Check the data bits with discrete value ranges in the interface data, and analyze the correctness of the output when the data bit value is one of 'each enumerated value of the valid domain', etc.\"\n  ]  \n}\n\n<<< Output Example 2 >>>\n\n```json\n{  \n  \"need_filter\": false,\n  \"safety_criterions\": [  \n    \"Ensure all interfaces have appropriate authentication mechanisms.\",\n    \"Check the data bits with discrete value ranges in the interface data, and analyze the correctness of the output when the data bit value is one of 'each enumerated value of the valid domain', etc.\"\n  ]  \n}\n```\n\n<<< Input >>>\n\n{\"safety_criterions\": [\"Message queue receiving\", \"Queue buffer handling\", \"Queue buffer handling\", \"Queue buffer handling\", \"Queue buffer handling\", \"Combined function settings\"]}\n\n<<< Output >>>"
